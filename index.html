            <p>Hi! My name is Ethan Nakamura, and I'm an active duty servicemeber. I currently work for 
            the United States Air Force as an intelligence analyst for the National Security Agency. While I can neither confirm nor deny if I've worked with aliens, 
            I can confirm that my almost six years of service will be coming to an end in February of 2022. I was raised by a single mother who later joined the ARMY 
            where she met my step-father. After experiencing the full lifecycle of a military family, I've realized that it's time for me to transition back to 
            civilian life. Being in the service allowed me to meet my wife, and as of 2020 we had our first baby, a boy. My life has since been filled with diaper 
            explosions, being kicked in the face during the night by little feet, and waking up at three in the morning to fulfill my most sought after job yet, the 
            milk-refill guy. At the ripe age of 28, I've discovered that nothing matters more to me than time and both with who and how I spend it. After the thousands 
            of hours of work and everything in my life that came with being in my profession I realized that it was time for me to re-assess this thing called life and 
            make a career change. I hope that my journey through coding will allow me to break out of the intelligence field and catch a new ride into a tech career. I 
            want to show companies what I have to offer, my experience and myself.</p>

            <h4>Why I'm Excited, Nov 14, 2021</h4>

            <p>Learning a new job is always difficult, I mean my current profession had about a one year job qualification timeline. I'm beyond excited to learn these new
                skills, return to civilian life, and find a sense of stability outside of the military. Being able to jumpstart a new career in a completely different 
                industry is something that I couldn't have thought of achieving so fast. I look forward to this learning journey and to what comes next.
