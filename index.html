            <p class="par">Hi! My name is Ethan Nakamura, and I'm an active duty servicemeber. I currently
                work for the United States Air Force as an intelligence analyst for the National
                Security Agency. While I can neither confirm nor deny if I've worked with aliens,
                I can confirm that my almost six years of service will be coming to an end in
                February of 2022. I was raised by a single mother who later joined the ARMY
                where she met my step-father. After experiencing the full lifecycle of a military
                family, I'v realized that it's time for me to transition back to civilian life.
                Being in the service allowed me to meet my wife, and as of 2020 we had our first
                baby, a boy. My life has since been filled with diaper explosions, being kicked in
                the face during the night by little feet, and waking up at three in the morning to
                fulfill my most sought after job yet, the milk-refill guy. At the ripe age of 28, I've
                discovered that nothing matters more to me than time and both with who and how I
                spend it. After the thousands of hours of work and everything in my life that came
                with being in my profession I realized that it was time for me to re-assess this
                thing called life and make a career change. I hope that my journey through coding
                will allow me to break out of the intelligence field and catch a new ride into a
                tech career. I want to show companies what I have to offer, my experience and
                myself.

            <p class="par">Learning a new job is always difficult, I mean my current profession
                had about a one year jobqualification timeline. I'm beyond excited to learn these
                new skills, return to civilian life, and find a sense of stability outside of the
                military. Being able to jumpstart a new career in a completely different industry
                is something that I couldn't have thought of achieving so fast. I look forward to this
                learning journey and to what comes next.
