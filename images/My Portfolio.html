    <h4>My Life's Trajectory, Nov 14, 2021</h4>

        <p style="font-family: &#39;Franklin Gothic Medium&#39;; color:black"> Hi! My name is Ethan Nakamura, and I'm an active duty servicemeber. I currently work for 
            the United States Air Force as an intelligence analyst for the National Security Agency. While I can neither confirm nor deny if I've worked with aliens, 
            I can confirm that my almost six years of service will be coming to an end in February of 2022. I was raised by a single mother who later joined the ARMY 
            where she met my step-father. After experiencing the full lifecycle of a military family, I've realized that it's time for me to transition back to 
            civilian life. Being in the service allowed me to meet my wife, and as of 2020 we had our first baby, a boy. My life has since been filled with diaper 
            explosions, being kicked in the face during the night by little feet, and waking up at three in the morning to fulfill my most sought after job yet, the 
            milk-refill guy. At the ripe age of 28, I've discovered that nothing matters more to me than time and both with who and how I spend it. After the thousands 
            of hours of work and everything in my life that came with being in my profession I realized that it was time for me to re-assess this thing called life and 
            make a career change. I hope that my journey through coding will allow me to break out of the intelligence field and catch a new ride into a tech career. I 
            want to show companies what I have to offer, my experience and myself.
        </p>

    <h4>What I Have to Offer, Nov 14, 2021</h4>

        <p style="font-family: &#39;Franklin Gothic Medium&#39;; color:black">
            Everyone comes from a different background, and we all have our own experiences that not only impact us in different ways but that shape our future selves.
            In a modern day work environment an individual needs to not only be knowledgeable of their responsibilities, they need to understand that there's more to 
            life than knowledge. Having dealt with life and death decisions for years, the only thing that matters are the people with you and how you work together. 
            You can be extremely knowledgable in your pursuits, but what's knowledge without the person who doesn't have the ability to effectively share that knowledge, 
            or better yet someone who cannot be relied on by a team. I've lead teams of dozens of servicemembers, advanced their technical expertise, enriched their lives, 
            and solidified the continuous growth of their work and awareness in a modern day social environment built up of a diverse group of people. I am able to
            do what it takes to not only find the knowledge that I need but know how to establish and work within a team to create a family of like minded professionals and
            friends who effectively communicate with one another to accomplish a mission.
